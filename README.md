## Abstract

This essay argues that civilisation’s creative longevity depends on the **managed preservation of neotenous cognition**—curiosity, play, and exploration—within protective institutional niches. Drawing on Alison Gopnik’s tripartite model of human intelligences (*Exploit, Explore, Empower*), it extends these ideas into an **entropic framework**, treating curiosity as a thermodynamic variable that must be subsidised and regulated.

The result is a vision of the **steady-state civilisation**—a society that sustains perpetual exploration through **equilibrium**, not expansion. Empirical evidence from cognitive economics, cooperative game theory, and aging research is incorporated to show that social systems can maintain innovation and well-being **without continuous material growth**.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Neoteny** | Retention of juvenile cognitive traits (curiosity, play) into adulthood |
| **Cognitive Sanctuaries** | Institutions (universities, labs) that subsidise exploration |
| **Entropy Converters** | Systems that absorb local disorder to preserve global order (Georgescu-Roegen) |
| **Steady-State Equilibrium** | $$\frac{dS_{\text{usable}}}{dt} = 0$$ — usable entropy conserved |
| **Thermodynamic Ethics** | Morality as entropy management: curiosity balanced by care |

## Core Proposals

1. **Universal Basic Income as Entropy Buffer**  
   $$ \mathrm{UBI} + \mathrm{Incentives}_{\mathrm{compression}} = \mathrm{Sustainable\ curiosity} $$

2. **Geozotic Lottery**  
   Diffuse innovation rewards via spatial decay:  
   $$ R(x) = R_0 e^{-\lambda d(x,x_0)} $$

3. **Entropy Efficiency Index**  
   $$ \eta_S = \frac{\Delta I}{\Delta E} $$
